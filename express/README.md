# Solana Action: Transfer SOL

## Source
https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-actions.git 

This example demonstrates a Solana Action built with Node.js using the Express
framework. It provides an API endpoint for transferring SOL.

## Setup

Navigate to `./examples/express`.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the application:

```
npm start
```

The server will start running on http://localhost:8080.

The endpoint for the Action is: nbv vt

You can test the Action on devnet as a Blink at https://dial.to/devnet:

I will quickly explain the idea of the blink. It is the board that has 10 rows and 10 columns.â€¨Users can pay SOL to move cursor forward. Those pays stay in the vault. When the game is over - it is on 100th square, the SOL gathered in vault is distributed to one user based on the probability and amount the SOL that is staked. After each line 50% the vault is also distributed to one user.
